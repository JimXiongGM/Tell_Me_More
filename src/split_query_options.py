1. What queries does the user make, disentangle them and list them line by line. You should identify the specific querying aspects (instead of general ones) and disentangle them.
2. For each query, what options does the user provide, list them after the query and "--" one by one, separated by a comma. If no options are parsed, leave the space after "--" empty.
Each time, the user will present a query. Please respond following the format given in the chat history. First, provide your thought, then present the response in a structured format."""
